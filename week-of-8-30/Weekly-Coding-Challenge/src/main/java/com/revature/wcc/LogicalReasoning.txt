We know that on Thursday the watch read 8:05pm when it should have read 8:00pm
We also know that on Monday morning, 84 hours later, the clock read 7:53pm when it should have read 8:00am
This would be a rate of change of -12min over 84 hours, or -1min/7hrs
Simple math tells us that the watch should have read the correct time 35hours after 8:00pm Thursday,
Or 7:00am Saturday morning.
