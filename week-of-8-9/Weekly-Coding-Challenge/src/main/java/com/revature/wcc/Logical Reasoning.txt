The answer is (b); the data in statement II alone is sufficient to answer the question.
Statement I is of no help, since a month can be 28, 30 or 31 days long, and thus the day the end of the month
falls on is irrelevant.
Statement II counts from the beginning of the month, and since 17 is a valid day for a third Saturday, we can calculate
what date any day will fall under.
